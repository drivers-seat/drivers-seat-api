      <div class="description">Use the Activities section inside the Earnings tab to get more insights into your shifts
        and the jobs you worked</div>
      <p class="no-margin">Want to take a closer look at the gig jobs you took on a particular day? Look no closer than
        the <b>Activities </b>section inside in the <b>Earnings </b>tab. </p>
      <p class="no-margin"></p>
      <p class="no-margin">Whether you're in the day, week, month, or year view, as long as you look at a period where
        you
        did at least one gig job, then you will see the <b>Activities</b> section.</p>
      <p class="no-margin"></p>
      <p class="no-margin">You will see a few different things on this page, let's walk through them one-by-one:</p>
      <p class="no-margin"></p>
      <p class="no-margin"><b>Engaged Time and Mileage Breakdowns</b></p>
      <p class="no-margin">You will see two pie charts, which will show how much of your <b>total work hours</b> and
        your
        <b>total work mileage</b> that you were <b><i>actually being paid for</i></b>.
      </p>
      <p class="no-margin"></p>
      <p class="no-margin">In other words, it shows your <b>engaged hours and</b> <b>mileage</b> as a percentage of
        total
        work.</p>
      <p class="no-margin"></p>
      <div class="container center"><img src="2797B885-F7EF-4501-8762-A407F8F9B40F_1_201_a.jpeg" width="200"></div>
      <p class="no-margin">Many gig apps will show you <b>engaged hours and mileage</b> while not showing you all the
        <b>non-engaged hours and mileage</b> that you had to put in to get paid.
      </p>
      <p class="no-margin"></p>
      <p class="no-margin">If you think about all of the time that you had to commute to the area you were working in,
        when you're waiting for new job requests, when you're getting gas, or even when you're running to the bathroom
        --
        this is work you have to do <b><i>that you don't get paid for.</i></b></p>
      <p class="no-margin"></p>
      <h4 id="h_083412ce0e">Viewing Activities for a Day</h4>
      <p class="no-margin">By clicking on the <b>edit my work time</b> link, you can edit your shifts. This is sometimes
        helpful in case you forgot to turn off your Driver's Seat shift tracking on or off. Read more about editing your
        shifts <a href="7208333-how-do-i-edit-my-work-time" target="_blank" class="intercom-content-link">here</a>.</p>
      <p class="no-margin"></p>
      <p class="no-margin"></p>
      <p class="no-margin"><b>Other Payments</b></p>
      <p class="no-margin">This section tells you if you received any payments from gig apps that wasn't associated with
        any particular job or work. You might receive these <b>Other Payments</b> if you got a bonus after completing a
        certain number of jobs, for example. If the gig apps make adjustments to your pay from a previous day, the
        adjustment may also appear in this section.</p>
      <p class="no-margin"></p>
      <div class="container center"><img src="787729D1-6071-473B-926A-78C82CA7DA1F_4_5005_c.jpeg" width="200"></div>
      <p class="no-margin"><b>Viewing your Work Blocks</b></p>
      <p class="no-margin">This section will show a collection of your Work Blocks performed throughout the day. Each
        Work
        Block will include a timetable of when you were performing specific jobs for gig apps, as well as when you were
        not engaged on any particular job.</p>
      <p class="no-margin"></p>
      <p class="no-margin">In addition, if you have tracked your Work Block from within Driver's Seat, you will see the
        miles you drove during that Work Block. The green-dot indicator tells you how good the mileage estimate is for
        that particular Work Block. </p>
      <p class="no-margin"></p>
      <p class="no-margin"><b>If the indicator is low,</b> remember to turn on Driver's Seat shift tracking during your
        work times.</p>

      <p class="no-margin">By clicking into any one of the individual jobs that you performed for a gig app, you will be
        able to see details on that trip, such as your <b>Pay</b>, your <b>Tips, </b>the time the job was <b>Requested
        </b>by a customer, and the <b>Start and Stop Times</b>.</p>
