        guesswork out of picking the best schedule for you! </h1>

        for focusing on what matters to you!</h1>
      <p class="no-margin"></p>
      <h2 id="h_4a663d9272">Insights Dashboard</h2>

        <li>
          <p class="no-margin">Updated with fresh data a few times a week.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="no-margin">Based on averages from the last 3 months, with recent data weighted more heavily so you
            can

        <li>
          <p class="no-margin">Estimated mileage expenses are calculated using real mileage data we receive from gig
            apps.
            Note that mileage is only included for engaged time (time spent with a passenger or delivery order in your
            car), so your actual mileage expenses will be higher. </p>

      </ul>
      <h2 id="h_3e597e4908">Settings</h2>
      <p class="no-margin">From the Best Times to Work dashboard, click the Settings icon (⚙️).</p>

      <h1 id="h_bcd124e49a">Don't see your metro area listed?</h1>
      <p class="no-margin">If you don't see your metro area listed as an option, it means we don't have enough users in
        your area to calculate average hourly pay. Here are some ways you can help:</p>
      <p class="no-margin"></p>
      <h2 id="h_09563f44d8">Invite a friend!</h2>
      <p class="no-margin">You can help bring this tool to workers to your area by recruiting more Driver's Seat users!
        At
        the bottom of the Best Times settings page, there is an option to send a friend an invitation to sign up for
        Driver's Seat. </p>

      <h2 id="h_124f686699">Make sure your accounts are connected</h2>
      <p class="no-margin">Another way you can help is by making sure all your gig accounts are connected. From the
        <b>Main Menu ≡</b>, click <b>Profile</b>, then <b>Services</b> to check your connected accounts. You might need
        to
        reconnect your accounts occasionally.
