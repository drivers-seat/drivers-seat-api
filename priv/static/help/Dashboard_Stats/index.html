          <p class="no-margin"><b>Net Pay:</b> Total pay minus estimated mileage expenses. Estimated mileage expenses
            are
            calculated using the 2022 IRS mileage rate of 62.5 cents/mile. The best way to make sure your mileage is
            accurate is to track your shifts, since we don't always get mileage data from your apps. When we do get
            mileage data from apps, it's usually just mileage from trips, not mileage while driving between jobs. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="no-margin"><b>Hourly Pay:</b> How much you earned per hour, calculated for both Gross and Net Pay.
            Hourly pay is calculated using work time we receive from you apps, plus time you tracked from logging
            shifts.
            When you track your shifts, hourly pay will be more accurate because it will include your total work time,
            and
            not just time spent on jobs.</p>
