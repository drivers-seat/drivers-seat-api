      <h1 id="h_9b82967411">Paid Time shows the percentage of time you were paid out of the total time spent working.
      </h1>
      <p class="no-margin"><b>Paid Time</b> is calculated using time data we get from your apps, plus time from you
        tracking your shifts. Tracking your shifts is the best way to make sure Paid Time is accurate, since we don't
        always get time data from your apps and when we do, it's usually just time spent on jobs.</p>
      <div class="container"><img src="IMG_1955.PNG"></div>
      <h1 id="h_8f2e59313c">Unpaid Time shows you how much time you spent working that you were not being paid by a gig
        app for. </h1>
      <p class="no-margin">You can see your <b>Unpaid Time</b>, plus a breakdown of your Paid Time by app on By Gig App.

      <h2 id="h_46f2ef0f59">Y<b>ou need to track your shifts</b>
      </h2>
      <p class="no-margin">We use shifts to determine total time working, which is needed for calculating Paid Time and
        Unpaid Time. Most gig apps only send us time spent on jobs so we need you to track your shifts for the app to
        know
        how much total time you spent working. </p>
      <p class="no-margin"></p>
      <h2 id="h_e3f2963c20"><b>We don't get any time data from your app</b></h2>
      <p class="no-margin">Most gig apps send us time spent on jobs, but some don't sent any time data at all. If we
        don't
        receive time spent on jobs from the gig app, you will not see Paid Time on the dashboard, and you will not see
        Work Time for your gig apps. </p>
