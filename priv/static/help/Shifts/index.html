      <p class="no-margin"><b>When you track your shifts, Driver's Seat will calculate your hourly pay based on Total
          Work
          Time.</b> This lets you keep track of time that might not get counted otherwise, like time spent waiting
        between
        jobs, traveling to pick up a food order or passenger, and time spent driving back to your work zone. </p>
      <p class="no-margin"></p>
      <p class="no-margin">If you don't track shifts, you might see some time data on the dashboard but it will be
        incomplete. The time data we get from your gig apps usually just includes time spent on jobs. <b>Track your
          shifts
          to make sure all your work time is accounted for!</b></p>
