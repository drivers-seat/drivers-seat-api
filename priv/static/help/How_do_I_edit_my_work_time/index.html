      <div class="description">The Work Time editor allows you to make changes to your shift tracking.</div>
      <p class="no-margin">Life as a gig worker can be hectic. If you're using Driver's Seat to track shifts, you might
        have fallen into one of these situations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="no-margin">You forgot to <b>turn off</b> shift tracking until the next day, so it tracked a bunch of
            hours you weren't working.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="no-margin">You forgot to <b>turn on</b> shift tracking until part-way through your jobs, so you
            under-counted the amount of time you were working that day.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="no-margin">Luckily, Driver's Seat allows you to edit your work time after the fact. Here's how you can
        do
        just that.</p>
      <p class="no-margin"></p>
      <h4 id="h_bd0845aaeb">
        <b>Step 1</b>: Access the "Earnings" tab and navigate to the "Day" view
      </h4>
      <p class="no-margin">You'll need to go to the "Day" view to modify a day's work schedule. The day must have at
        least
        one gig job tracked for you to be able to modify that day's work time.</p>

      <p class="no-margin"></p>
      <h4 id="h_f19a22e80f">
        <b>Step 2</b>: Click on "edit my work time"
      </h4>
      <p class="no-margin">Above the chart, you'll see a link called "edit my work time." Click on it to access the Work
        Time calendar.</p>

      <p class="no-margin"></p>
      <h4 id="h_5c50a381ac">
        <b>Step 3</b>: Edit work time in the Work Time calendar
      </h4>
      <p class="no-margin">You have a couple of options to edit your work time:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="no-margin"><b>Option 1: Manually add or remove time blocks.</b> Each block in the Work Time calendar
            represents 5 minutes. To add or remove time, tap on the desired blocks in the calendar view. You can add or
            remove multiple blocks at once to easily adjust your work time.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="intercom-container center"><img src="81511D58-5ACE-4235-96DD-6623D3608AE3.gif" width="200"></div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="no-margin"><b>Option 2: Clear non-engaged time blocks.</b> To save yourself time, you can remove big
            time blocks when you didn't have any work. Simply click on one of the buttons next to "Clear non-engaged
            time
            blocks" at the top of the screen. You can remove all unengaged time blocks larger than 15 minutes, 30
            minutes,
            or an hour.</p>
          <p class="no-margin"></p>
          <p class="center no-margin"><i>In this example, we cleared all non-engaged time blocks larger
              than 30 minutes.</i></p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="h_871da65d3f">
        <b>Step 4</b>: Confirm the total time to be removed or added, and click save.
      </h4>
      <p class="no-margin">Before saving your changes, look at the bottom of the screen to see how much time will be
        removed. This will help you ensure that your edits are accurate.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="no-margin">Once satisfied with your adjustments, click the "Save" button to confirm your changes. Your
        edited work time will now be reflected in the app, and you can continue using Driver's Seat with confidence,
        knowing that your work time and earnings levels are accurately tracked.</p>
