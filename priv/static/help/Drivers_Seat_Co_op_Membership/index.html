      <h1 id="h_fcda0fb32c">Driver's Seat is different from other driver apps because we're a co-op, owned by rideshare
        and delivery workers like you.</h1>
      <h1 id="h_99f3e2a723">What is a co-op?</h1>
      <p class="no-margin">A co-op, or cooperative, is a kind of business that is owned and run by its members for their
        benefit. Driver's Seat is a user-owned co-op. This means users can get a share of the profits we generate and
        have
        a say in deciding the future of Driver's Seat. Our mission is to help gig workers have more control at work, so
        it
        only makes sense to make sure gig workers are at the center!</p>
